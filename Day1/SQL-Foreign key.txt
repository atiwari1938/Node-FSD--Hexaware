A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key or a unique key of another table.
A foreign key relationship involves a parent table that holds the initial column values, and a child table with column values that reference the parent column values. A foreign key constraint is defined on the child table.
A FK enforce relationships between tables, ensuring that data remains consistent and accurate.


In MySQL, you can implement foreign keys using the FOREIGN KEY constraint when creating or altering tables.


CREATE TABLE Dept(
	deptno  INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dname   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    loc    VARCHAR(100)
);


CREATE TABLE Emps
(
	empno INT PRIMARY KEY,
	ename VARCHAR(100),
	job   VARCHAR(100),
	salary   INT,
	deptno INT
);

ALTER TABLE Dept
ADD COLUMN empno INT,
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_emps FOREIGN KEY (empno) REFERENCES Emps(empno);
