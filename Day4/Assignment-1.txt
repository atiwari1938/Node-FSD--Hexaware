What is Regular expression in JavaScript?
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

How to use Regular Expressions in JavaScript?
Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:

const re = /ab+c/;
Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.
Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:
const re = new RegExp("ab+c");

Go through the details of  javascript array methods :  
				map, find, findindex, filter

map(): The map() method creates a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array.

find(): The find() method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns undefined.

findIndex(): The findIndex() method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns -1.

filter(): The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
